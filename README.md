- I’m interested in developing C++ based software and solutions for applied cryptography problems using C++.
- You will find implementations of various data structures like Trees, Graphs in addition to Cryptographic implementations
- I have implemented some of the assignments (optional) of Cryptography I course from Standford University by Prof. Dan Boneh (that I completed in 2019). I have implemented Assignments 1, 2, 3 and have added them as repositories
- Assignment 1 - ProblemSet1.py
- Assignment2/AES - AES CBC and CTR modes (in C++) using Crypto++ API. CBC encrypt/decryt uses PKSC#5 padding. The implementation is in the AES repo. 
- Assignment 3 - StreamingFileAuthenticator.py: Hash validation using SHA256 (in Python)
